        <h1> My favorite steminist</h1>
        <p> Over here, I will be talking about the steminist Emelie du Chatalet. emelie du Chatalet was born on July 17th 1706, into a very aristocratic family. In her family, there wasn't any other way to make it other than courting. However, she fell in love with mathematics, and one of her tutors inspired her to pursue it. </p>
        
        <p> In terms of her work, she mainly focused herslef on natural philosiphy, especially on the works of <b><i>Newton, Leibniz and Wolff.</i></b> She had a very advanced knowledge of physics which allowed her to write very well on Newtonian physics. She was also freinds with many well known figures at the time, such as <b><i>Voltaire and Koenig.</i></b> She had a brilliant mind, an she is still celebrated to this day as one of the female pioneers of the field of physiscs.</p>
