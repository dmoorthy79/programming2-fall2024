        <p><b>Ingredients: </b> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>12 medium ripe plums, halved and pitted</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons cinnamon sugar, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 1:</b>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch springform pan.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2: </b>Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl and sift on top of the butter mixture; mix to combine. Transfer batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth out.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3:</b> Set plums inside batter, cut-side up, and sprinkle evenly with cinnamon-sugar.</p>
        <p><b>Step 4:</b> Bake in the preheated oven on the lowest rack until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm or cool to room temperature.</p>
